Crystal Collector Challenge
created by Jennifer Gaumnitz

<!-- What the project does -->

 Here's how this game works:

   * Four clickable crystals are displayed on the page.

   * The player is shown a random target number (between 19 and 120) at the start of round of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points (between 1 and 12) to the player's total score. 

     * The game does not disclose the crystal's value until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When the player clicks a crystal, the player's score is updated in the "Your points" counter.

   * The player wins if their pints matches the target number.

   * The player loses if their score exceeds the random number.

   * The game keeps track of wins and losses (as long as the browser window is not refreshed), and a new round begins whenever the player wins or loses.

   * When a new round begins again, the player sees a new random number, and all the crystals have four new hidden values. The user's points resets to 0.

There is background music, although Chrome sometimes won't play it. It's called "Adventure" from Bensound (credit and link at the bottom of the screen).

<!-- Why the project is useful -->
The game fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides working with creating random numbers and assigning them to elements, the assignment also taught me how to use modals in Bootstrap.

<!-- How users can get started with the project -->
Just play the game. Not as fun as Pokemon Go, for sure.
